Collaborative activity: Mini case 1 - Linear programming

Consider the WhiskasModel1.py
What are the two parameters that the LpProblem function implements? 
The first parameter is the name “The Whiskas Problem” and it represents the name of the linear program. The second parameter is “LPMinimize” and it indicates the type of the objective of the problem that is to minimize the objective function. 

Is it mandatory to name thr prob variable as prob?
 No, it is not mandatory, we can choose any valid variable that describes and makes sense. 

What are LpContinous and LpInteger used for?

Explain and copy the section of code that defines the objective function.

Explain and copy the section of code that defines the constraints.

Is this a minimization or maximization problem?

Run the WhiskasModel1.py code. (no need to make changes, just runt it as is) What is the value of the following variables. 
Status: 
Beef Percent =66.0
 Chicken Percent =34.0
Total Cost of Ingredients per can =0.97
OPTIONAL - (5/100 Extra Points for Final Test) Write all your answers as a markdown document (.md) and upload it to your github account.
